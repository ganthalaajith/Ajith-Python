Hello all !!

we are doing the classification of admissions based upon the data available by K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm.

What is KNN Algorithm ?
KNN can be defined as K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm, where it stores all the values in dataset and classifies the new data or case or value considering the value of most similar instances(nearest neighbours).
It suggests that if the particular value is similar to its neighbours then it is one of them.

What is k ?
 K denotes no.of nearest neighbour which are voting for the class of new data or testing data.

For Example:
If diary milk looks similar to fivestar, kitkat, munch rather than thumpsup, maaza, monster, mountaindew, then dairymilk comes under group of choclates, and thumsup and its neighbours comes under softdrinks.

How to choose k value ?
It can be choosed using distance formulas like euclidean distance and manhattan distance	 

KNN is also called as Lazy Learning, becuase it memorises the training data there is learning phase of the module, and all of the work happens at the time of prediction is requested.

I've attached python file, excel data file into the repository.
